# Smoke Detection With Fire Prevention Using Cisco Packet Tracer

# INTRODUCTION :

In our envisioned system, we leverage Internet of Things (IoT) technology along with a smoke sensor to notify different household appliances to take appropriate actions in the event of a fire. This system is valuable as it not only triggers an alarm but also instructs household appliances to respond accordingly. 
We have implemented this solution using Cisco Packet Tracer, a network simulator that offers a diverse range of Cisco switches, routers, and wireless devices. Cisco Packet Tracer not only supports physical simulation but also serves as an assessment tool, enabling the creation of practical networking models.

# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

The goal of this project is to establish an intelligent smoke detection system with built-in fire prevention features. Unlike traditional smoke detectors that only identify smoke without the ability to take immediate preventive actions, this initiative aims to create a sophisticated system. 
The objective is to accurately identify smoke in various environments and activate proactive measures to minimize or eliminate fire risks. The system will seamlessly integrate with other devices and systems, including fire suppression and emergency services, ensuring a well-coordinated and swift response during fire emergencies. 
The primary aim is to enhance safety, prevent property damage, and save lives by efficiently detecting and preventing fires before they escalate.

# PROJECT IDEA:

Our system, incorporating a smoke sensor, is configured with a threshold of 0.5. This signifies that appropriate measures will be taken if the sensor detects smoke levels surpassing the predefined threshold. The setting can be adjusted based on individual preferences, specific circumstances, or environmental conditions. 
In the event of a fire, the sprinklers activate to curb the spread of flames within the house.

# CONDITIONS:

To execute the project, specific conditions must be defined for activating and deactivating all devices. 
The state of the devices will vary based on the dynamic changes in these conditions. 
Cars are employed to simulate smoke in the simulation. 

The critical conditions outlined above for this simulation include:
